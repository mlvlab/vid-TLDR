# Action Detection

## Installation

Please follow the installation instructions in [INSTALL](../INSTALL.md).

:warning: Note that you have to set ava datapath `DATA_DIR` in `alphaction/config/paths_catalog.py`.

## Datasets

You can find the dataset instructions in [DATASET](../DATASET.md).

## Finetuning

For finetuning, you can simply run the pretraining scripts in `exp` as follows:
```shell
bash ./exp/b16_ptk710_ftk710_ftava_f8_res224.sh
```

:warning: **Notes:**
1. Chage `MODEL_PATH` to your model path.
2. For ViT-L, we set `--close_amp` to close amp for stable finetuning.
3. Since we pretrain the models on Kinetics with sparse sampling, the frame span should be similar for better performance. Thus we set `--sparse` to use a large frame span 300, which is equal to the average frame number of Kinetics clips.
